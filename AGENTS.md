# Volontyorlar Coordinator Portal — Agent Guide

This repository is the private portal a **coordinator** signs into: they create
the volunteering that students apply to, decide who is accepted, and confirm who
turned up. Read this file before meaningful work, then use
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) to load only what the task needs.

It follows the codebase patterns of the volunteer application in `../v-app` —
the same tokens and typeface, the same route registry, the same server-only API
client and Zod-parsed responses, the same `ActionResult` envelope, the same
documentation layout and verification loop. It does not carry its history, its
volunteer routes, or its whiteboard ground. See [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).

## The one thing to know first

**The backend is still being written, and this repository never pretends
otherwise.** So:

- **`src/lib/api/endpoints.ts` is the only list of operations this portal
  calls,** and each carries a status: `published` (in
  `v-backend/docs/api/openapi.json` today), `announced` (in `v-backend`'s
  source, not yet published), `requested` (needed, not defined anywhere yet).
  `endpoints.test.ts` fails if a `published` entry is missing from the generated
  document _or_ if a non-`published` one has appeared in it. Do not add an
  endpoint without a status, and do not mark one `published` to quiet a test;
- **an unpublished route that answers `404` with no error code renders
  "waiting for the API", naming the method and path.** A `404` _with_ a code is
  a missing or unauthorised record. See
  [`.agent-memory/uncoded-404-means-no-route.md`](.agent-memory/uncoded-404-means-no-route.md);
- **fixtures exist in exactly two places:** `e2e/stub-backend.mjs` and
  `src/lib/fixtures/`, the latter reachable only through
  `VOLONTYORLAR_FIXTURES=on`, refused in production, and announced by a banner on
  every page. Never fabricate a successful sign-in, a record, or a count anywhere
  else;
- **every read is `read()` and every write is `write()`** in
  `src/lib/api/gateway.server.ts`. A page receives a `Loaded<T>` envelope, never
  an exception, and renders `LoadFailure` for whichever failure it got. A response the Zod schema in `src/lib/api/schemas.ts` rejects is an error,
  never a guess;
- **the portal needs `VOLONTYORLAR_API_URL` and
  `VOLONTYORLAR_STAFF_SESSION_SECRET`.** Both are server-only. Without them
  sign-in says it is unavailable and every protected route returns to it.

## Repository boundary

This repository owns one audience's screens. It does not own the volunteer
application (`../v-app`), the marketing site (`../v-web`), the administrator
portal (`../v-admin`), or the API, database, authorisation and audit
(`../v-backend`). A control hidden here is never authorisation.

`v-staff` and `v-admin` are deliberately separate repositories with separate
lockfiles, cookies and secrets. What differs between them is confined to three
files: `src/lib/portal.ts`, `src/lib/api/endpoints.ts` and
`src/lib/routing/routes.ts`. Keep it that way — a fix that belongs to both
belongs in the shared shape, applied to both.

## Technology stack

- Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, strict TypeScript with
  `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, Node.js 22.13+
- Tailwind CSS 4, semantic tokens in `src/app/globals.css`
- `next-intl` for `uz` / `ru` / `en`, one catalog per locale, locale-prefixed
  routes
- shadcn/ui primitives in `src/components/ui/` on `radix-ui`, `cva`, `clsx`,
  `tailwind-merge`, Lucide
- React Hook Form's `zodResolver` is **not** used: forms are Server Actions with
  `useActionState`, and Zod validates on the server
- `openapi-fetch` over generated types, `jose` for the encrypted cookie,
  `server-only` on every server module
- Vitest and Testing Library for units, Playwright with a stub backend for e2e
- npm with a committed lockfile

Middleware is called Proxy in Next.js 16 (`src/proxy.ts`). For framework
behaviour read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before relying on older knowledge.

## Critical rules

- **No signup, anywhere.** There is no `/signup`, no "create an account", no
  password recovery, and no invitation on the sign-in page. Coordinators are
  created by an administrator in `v-admin`. A test asserts the route registry has
  exactly one guest route and that no catalog key is named after account
  creation or password recovery.
- **Never request, render, cache, log or imply an existing password.** The only
  password operation on another account is assigning a **replacement** temporary
  one, which forces a change and ends their sessions. The screen says so before
  the field.
- **Both tokens stay server-side.** They live in the encrypted `httpOnly`
  cookie, the server-only client, and `v-backend`. Never a Client Component,
  never storage, never a URL, never the HTML.
- **The role is checked twice and enforced elsewhere.** `src/proxy.ts` and the
  `(portal)` layout both verify it; `v-backend` is what actually stops a
  coordinator reading another's data. Do not describe a hidden control as a
  permission.
- **Every screen is private.** `noindex` in the layout, `X-Robots-Tag` on every
  response, `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, and `robots.txt` disallowing all.
- **Every user-facing string exists in `uz`, `ru` and `en`.** Uzbek uses the
  turned comma `ʻ` (U+02BB); Russian is Cyrillic. A test enforces key parity and
  ICU argument parity. Client components receive labels as props — the root
  layout passes `messages={null}`.
- **A `"use server"` file may export only async functions.** Schemas live beside
  their actions. See
  [`.agent-memory/use-server-exports.md`](.agent-memory/use-server-exports.md).
- **Backend data is never re-shaped in JSX.** Parse once with a schema; render
  the schema's output or a state panel.
- **Every list ships loading, empty, no-matches and failure; every write ships
  pending, error and success.** A success message must survive the revalidation
  that follows it — see
  [`.agent-memory/resolved-attendance-stays.md`](.agent-memory/resolved-attendance-stays.md).
- **Filters are a GET form and pagination is links**, so both work without
  JavaScript and can be shared. Read query state only through
  `src/lib/routing/search-params.ts`, which accepts only listed values.
- **Two brand colours with one role each**, plus `danger` for destructive
  confirmations. Semantic tokens only, never a literal hex.
- Preserve keyboard access, visible focus, one `h1` per page, reduced motion and
  responsive behaviour.
- Update `/docs` when stable environment or architecture behaviour changes.

## Code conventions

- **Source files carry no comments.** Explanations go in `/docs`. Names, types
  and test names carry intent. Compiler and linter directives are not comments.
- Server Components by default; `"use client"` only for an event handler, client
  state or a browser API, with the boundary as low as practical.
- Internal links use `Link` from `@/i18n/navigation` with `navHref()`, which adds
  the locale prefix itself. `localePath()` is for plain anchors and redirects.
- Domain logic lives under `src/lib/<domain>/` with its tests beside it and no
  JSX. Components compose it.
- Test names state the behaviour and its reason, not the function name.

## Default verification

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
git diff --check
```

Add `npm run build` for build or deployment work, and `npm run test:e2e` when
routing, permissions or the information architecture change. For UI work also
inspect the affected screens at both widths, in both themes, and with reduced
motion.

To add a section, an endpoint, copy, a form or a state, follow
[`docs/operations/EXTENDING.md`](docs/operations/EXTENDING.md).

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

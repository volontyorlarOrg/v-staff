## Source-of-truth order

When sources disagree, investigate in this order:

1. executable code;
2. current configuration;
3. `AGENTS.md`;
4. current `/docs`;
5. persistent memory.

## Documentation boundary

These pages separate three kinds of truth:

- **Implemented** — verified in current source or configuration.
- **Presented** — product direction, not proof of an implementation.
- **Needs verification** — no evidence is available in the workspace.

Unknowns stay explicit. They are not filled with an assumed contract, hostname
or claim. The endpoint registry is the same discipline applied to the API: an
operation this portal calls is marked `published`, `announced` or `requested`,
and a test keeps those labels honest.
